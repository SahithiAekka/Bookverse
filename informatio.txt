I am preparing a high-impact AWS Cloud Engineer portfolio project to land a cloud engineering job and want to be in the top 1% of applicants.

I have AWS Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect Associate, and AI Practitioner certifications, and I am comfortable with Python.

I want to build a full-stack microservices app with a React frontend and Flask backend microservices deployed on AWS ECS Fargate, with RDS as the database, using best practices like secure secrets management, monitoring, and CI/CD with CodePipeline and GitHub integration.

I can spend up to 2 days on this project and want a clear 2-day execution plan, a detailed GitHub folder structure, and advice on how to present the project effectively to recruiters.

Please help me by:

Proposing a top-tier project idea aligned with AWS cloud engineer job requirements

Giving me a concise, phased execution plan for 2 days

Designing a detailed GitHub repo structure for this project

Guiding me on how to write a strong README and recruiter-facing launch post

Offering a step-by-step build and deployment checklist

I want all recommendations to be realistic to finish within 2 days and maximize my chances of getting hired.



🚀 Day 1 (10 hours) – Backend + Infra Core
✅ Task	Description
1. Setup GitHub repo	Create bookverse repo with correct structure (see below)
2. Create 3 Flask microservices	user_service, book_service, review_service — each with basic CRUD APIs
3. Dockerize all services	Add Dockerfile + test locally with docker run
4. Create & push to ECR	aws ecr create-repository + docker push
5. Create RDS PostgreSQL	Use Console or CloudFormation; create users, books, reviews tables
6. Configure ECS Fargate	Create Cluster + 3 services (1 per task) + ALB for routing
7. Add IAM roles + Secrets Manager	Store DB creds securely and pull into Flask apps
8. Test all APIs with Postman	Ensure end-to-end flow works

✅ Checkpoint: All backend services live on ECS + connected to RDS + secured with Secrets Manager

🌐 Day 2 (8–10 hours) – Frontend + CI/CD + Polish
✅ Task	Description
1. Build simple React frontend	Register/login user, list books, submit reviews
2. Host frontend on S3 + CloudFront	Make it public, enable HTTPS (ACM)
3. Set up CI/CD with CodePipeline	Triggered on GitHub push → deploy to ECS & S3
4. Add CloudWatch + Alarms	Basic logs + error alerting (e.g., CPU, HTTP 5xx)
5. Add README.md	Include diagram, architecture explanation, setup steps
6. Write your LinkedIn launch post	“Just deployed BookVerse – a full-stack AWS cloud app using ECS Fargate…”
7. Final polish + GitHub push	Ensure everything is clear, clean, and recruiter-ready

✅ Checkpoint: Fully deployed full-stack app, CI/CD wired, clean GitHub repo, and ready for launch.
